Why Golang?
    Unique Features
    Take advantage of hardware improvements
    Concurrency
    Integrations with 'C'

Paradox of Choice
    Barry Shwartz

Simplicity
    25 keywords
        package, import, func, var, if, for, switch, go, chan, select, range, type, struct, interface, etc
    No classes (only structs & functions)
    No Inheritance (only composition)
    No Exceptions (only errors)
    No try catch finally construct
    No access modifiers (public, private etc)

Built for Concurrency
    Concurrency is built in the language
        4MB for an OS thread
        4KB of memory for goroutines
    Language features for Concurrency
        go, chan, select, range, close()

Close to hardware
    No *VM
    Not interpreted  (but compiled)

Data Types in Golang
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real float32, imaginary float32)
    complex128 (real float64, imaginary float64)

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32, represents 1 unicode character)

functions
    - can return more than one value
    - variadic functions are supported (varying number of arguments)
    - higher order functions are supported
        assign functions to variables
        functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        functions can be returned as return values
